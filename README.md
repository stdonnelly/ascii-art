# ASCII art text generator

This program was originally created by me between 30 August, 2016 and 23 November, 2016. I more recently decided to take it and upload it to GitHub. There were several changes made to make the program run on both Linux and Windows, since it was originally only written for Windows. Anything that is denoted by EDIT or and comments labeled TODO in the original commit were changed after 2016. I noticed many possible imporvements while I was reading this program, and may improve this program. The word "EDIT" will be removed on subsequent commits.

This is the original splash screen, it pretty much sums up what the program does:
```
This is a tool to convert text into:
            ___     ___   _____  _____                 ___    _____    
    /\     /   \   /   \    |      |           /\     |   \     |    |
   /__\    \___   |         |      |          /__\    |___/     |    |
  /    \       \  |         |      |         /    \   |   \     |    |
 /      \  \___/   \___/  __|__  __|__      /      \  |    \    |    .
How to use:
Type the text that you wish to convert.
Max word size: 7
Any higher and program will put the rest on the next line.
If you have already used this program,
It will put the ASCII art right after the last used session.
(Note: Does not work for every font,
"Courier New" or "Consolas" is recomended
for viewing output text. No others have been tested.)
Commands (~save, yes, no) are case sensitive.
However, input text is not case sensative.
This will always output capital letters.
